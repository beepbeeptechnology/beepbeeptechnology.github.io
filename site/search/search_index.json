Nearly everybody needs to use data, whether to make decisions, validate experimental outcomes, train machine learning models... the list goes on. But the tools and techniques required to ensure that data is available, reliable and easy to use are also increasing exponentially in variety and complexity. You don't want to have to learn these tools and approaches in order to get the data you want exactly where you need it, consistently. That's where we come in. Approach We understand that most people want this complexity to be abstracted away. You just want to be able to get the data you want into the tools and places they need it, and you need to be sure that it is: timely reliable accurate well structured Additionally, we provide native tools to aggregate, integrate and augment your data with statistical analyses, computation and data from external APIs. The opportunities are virtually limitless.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#philosophy","text":"Whether you think that data is the new oil or soil, there's no getting away from the fact that there's rather a lot of it, and the breadth and volume is increasing exponentially.

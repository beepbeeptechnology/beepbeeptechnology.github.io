# Outbound Data Automation
Transformed data is made available for downstream tools and services as BigQuery views (dynamic data which will auto-refresh when queried) and/or BigQuery tables (periodically refreshed and typically faster to query).  

The tool you want to use to connect to your data should have a native BigQuery connector.  If it doesn't then you can optionally:



* Use a different tool
* Get them to build a connector
* Find a workaroud (usually via Google Sheets)

# Overview

## Philosophy
Whether you think that data is the new oil or soil, there's no getting away from the fact that there's rather a lot of it, and the breadth and volume is increasing exponentially.

Everybody needs to use data, but the tools and techniques required to ensure that data is available, reliable and easy to use are also increasing exponentially in variety and complexity.

You don't want to have to learn these tools and approaches in order to get your data where you need it consistently.

That's where we come in.


## Approach
We understand that most people want this complexity to be abstracted away.  You just want to be able to get the data you want into the tools and places they need it, and you need to be sure that it is:
    * timely
    * reliable
    * accurate
    * well structure
